# Completist
Completist is an interactive Web Application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Web Application functions as a task organiser where users can log tasks, edit logged tasks and check and delete logged tasks. Completist was built to be responsive and be easily usable on a wide range of platforms, from desktop to mobile.

# User Experience

## Design
* **Colour Scheme**
    * I used a lighter shade of Orange for the background and a darker shade of Orange for the div that holds each task to give a slight contrast between each task.
* **Typography**
    * Noto Serif is used as the font for the main logo, with serif as a fallback font if Noto Serif fails to load. I used this font as it stands out from the rest of the main body creates a clean contrast.
    * Inter is used as the font used for the main body, with sans-serif as a fallback font if Inter fails to load. This font is used because it is very clean and simple which makes it easy to understand and use.
# Features
## Main Logo
* The Main Logo uses the Noto Serif with a bold font weight to create a strong impression to the user. An icon is also used in the main logo which visually enhances the Logo.
## Add Task Button
*  The Add Task Button is located next to the Main Logo and when clicked, reveals the Add Task Form.
This button helps to keep the user's screen free from clutter, so that the the Add Task Form only appears when the user wants to actually add a task.
## Add Task Form
* The Add Task Form features a very clean and minimal design that makes it easy for the user to input their task and confirm it.
## Task Display Area
* The Task Display Area clearly separates each task and makes it easy for the user to distinguish between each task.
## Delete Task Button
* The Delete Button allows the user to remove any task they have added. The button contains a trash can, giving a clear visual indication that the button is used to remove a task.
## Edit Task Button
* The Edit Task Button allows the user to edit tasks at the click of button. When the button is clicked, the task text is selected and the user is able to edit their task. The content of the button is also changed from the edit icon, to the save icon, giving the user indication to click the button again to save their changes. Once the Save Button is clicked, the text is locked in and the content of the button is changed back to the edit icon so the user may edit again if they please.
## Task Checkbox
* The Task Checkbox is interactive so that when the user checks it, the task is crossed off, making it easy for the user to keep track of their tasks.
