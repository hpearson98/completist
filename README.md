Completist was built to be responsive and be easily usable on a wide range of platforms, from desktop to mobile.

# User Experience

## Design
* **Colour Scheme**
    * I used a lighter shade of Orange for the background and a darker shade of Orange for the div that holds each task to give a slight contrast between each task.
* **Typography**
    * Noto Serif is used as the font for the main logo. I used this font as it stands out from the rest of the main body creates a clean contrast.
    * Inter is used as the font used for the main body. This font is used because it is very clean and simple which makes it easy to understand and use.
